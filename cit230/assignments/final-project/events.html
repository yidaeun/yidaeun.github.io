                    <h2>Great Divide Mountain Bike Route</h2>
                    <h4>From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia</h4>
                    <p>The Great Divide Mountain Bike Route (GDMBR) is a long-distance, off-road bicycle touring route from Banff, Alberta, Canada to Antelope Wells, New Mexico, USA. As of 2016, the route is 2768.4 miles (4455.3 km) long; its length is likely to change over time as the GDMBR is continually being refined. The GDMBR was developed by Adventure Cycling Association and was completed in 1997.[1][2] A set of highly detailed route maps and a guidebook are available from Adventure Cycling.</p>
                    <p>Following the Continental Divide as closely as practicable and crossing it 30 times, about 90% of the GDMBR is on unpaved roads and trails and requires basic off-pavement riding skills to complete. The unpaved portions of the route range from high quality dirt or gravel roads to a few short sections of unmaintained trails which may not be possible for most people to ride at all. The GDMBR has over 200,000 feet (60,960 meters) of elevation gain and loss for the rider to contend with. While most of the GDMBR is off the pavement, the route does not require highly technical mountain bike riding skills. The route has been designed to provide a riding experience primarily on very low trafficked roads through mostly undeveloped areas of the Rocky Mountain west.</p>
